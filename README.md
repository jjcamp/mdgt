mdgt (spoken: "midget") is a microservice which parses microdata.  mdgt is still
in the initial design and development phase.

Windows users: use the handy win_init.ps1 script to set up the virtual
environment and install dependencies to it. PyPI doesn't have 64-bit binaries
for lxml, so the whl file is included and installed from the script.

Linux/Mac users: set up your virtual environment and use the requirements file
to install dependencies.
